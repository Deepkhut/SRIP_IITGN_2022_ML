### TASK #1: Animate bivariate normal distribution.
   + Ploted an Bivariate Normal distribution using JAX,Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries with the help of Cholesky Decomposition method.



### TASK #2: Implement from scratch a sampling method to draw samples from a multivariate Normal (MVN) distribution in JAX.
   + Generated an sampling method which draws out samples from Multivariate Normal (MVN) distribution for any Dimension.



### TASK #3: Implement two hidden layers neural network classifier from scratch in JAX
   + Created an Convolutional Neural Network which gives 98.9% accuracy on MNIST Dataset. 



### TASK #4: Bayesian Linear Regression from scratch with BlackJAX 
   + Implementedan Bayesian Linear Regression in JAX library and created an sample dataset using BlackJAX.
